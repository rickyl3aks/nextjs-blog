The stated purpose of the YoRHa organization and its androids is to serve the **Council of Humanity** and reclaim Earth from the aliens and their machine lifeforms. This would ultimately allow the surviving humans on the moon to return to Earth.

In actuality, however, this is not the case. The Council of Humanity was created as part of Project YoRHa: the organization does not exist, and **humanity was extinct** before the aliens even arrived on Earth, following the failure of Project Gestalt. Knowledge of humanity's extinction was affecting morale among the androids fighting on the surface, and so a false narrative about humans surviving on the moon was created, along with an elite force of androids to spread this message. This was masterminded from the facility called **the Bunker**.

Once this was achieved, a final plan was set into motion to destroy any evidence of the deception by allowing the **Machine Network access to the Bunker**, wiping out Project YoRHa. A new line of even more powerful android models would then be produced to continue the fight against the machines, they and the older androids on Earth all now believing that they were fighting for humanity.
