YoRHa is an elite military force of androids charged by the **Council of Humanity** with fighting the invading aliens and their machine lifeforms. Stationed on the thirteenth orbital base, known as the Bunker, they are constantly fighting to reclaim Earth for the human race.

The term **"YoRHa"** is used to refer to two distinct concepts: the first is the organization itself, an offshoot of the android central command from the previous machine wars. Other androids are part of a larger military organization referred to as the "Army of Humanity" that first formed in the year 5013.

The second use is to refer to the **advanced androids** ("YoRHa units") that form the organization, as distinct from previous android models still present on Earth.
